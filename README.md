# Simple demo of C++ Pimpl programming technique



>"Pointer to implementation" or "pImpl" is a C++ programming technique that removes implementation details of a class from its object representation by placing them in a separate class, accessed through an opaque pointer

```cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
